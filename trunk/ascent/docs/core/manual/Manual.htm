 <h2><a name="Overview"/>Overview</h2><p>The Ascent Design Studio is a 
 collection of algorithms/frameworks for the deployment and configuration of distributed, real-time, and embedded systems. ASCENT contains frameworks for: </p><ul><li>Automated deployment planning with real-time scheduling, co-location constraints,   resource constraints, and network topology/resource constraints </li><li>Deployment optimization algorithms </li><li>An implementation of a self-healing/self-configuration framework for applications   built with the Java Spring framework  </li><li>Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) based automated feature model configurators </li><li>An implementation of the Filtered Cartesian Flattening (FCF) algorithm for algorithmically selecting valid feature sets from feature models that adhere to resource constraints </li><li>ASCENT includes an implementation of the Configuration ExploratioN Technique (ASCENT). The ASCENT algorithm takes one or more models of the hardware and software variability in a system and can solve for an optimal design configuration. The optimization goal is configurable. Ascent also produces a graph of the key trends in the solution space that can be used to perform a number of resource-based design analyses, such as finding the minimum cost to produce a solution with a given value. </li></ul><h2><a name="Getting_Started"/>Getting Started</h2><p>New users should start by looking at the wiki pages for the features they are interested in: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ascent-design-studio/w/list" rel="nofollow">Go to the wiki</a>. </p>
